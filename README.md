# Tortoise-Hare-Race
Visual representation of random number generation in C and its potential applications.

In this program the tortoise (T) and hare (H) race using random number generation. The tortoise will move slower but has a smaller chance of slippage and moving backward. Whereas, the Hare will move faster but has a greater chance of slippage. If both the T and H land in the same position at any point throughout the race, "ouch!" will be printed to represent them running into each other. The program ends when the T or H wins the race and it returns a message for the winner.
